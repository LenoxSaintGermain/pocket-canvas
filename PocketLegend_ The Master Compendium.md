# **PocketLegend: The Master Compendium**

Version: 1.0  
Date: November 2025  
Status: Confidential / IP Development

## **1\. Product Identity & Vision**

### **The Concept**

**PocketLegend** (formerly GrooveForge) is a web-based AI music creation tool that wraps the complex power of Generative Audio (Suno API) inside the nostalgic, tactile interface of an early 2000s "Click Wheel" music player.

It is not just a tool; it is an **RPG (Role-Playing Game)**. Users do not just "prompt music"; they take on the role of a Manager/Producer, guiding a synthetic artist from "Bedroom Beatmaker" to "Global Icon" using a specialized "Sonic DNA" system.

### **Pitch Assets**

* **Log Line:** A retro-futuristic music RPG where the click-wheel of 2001 controls the AI audio magic of 2026, allowing users to build chart-topping synthetic artists from the palm of their hand.  
* **The Hook:** "Click to Create Legends. Your Turntable for Tomorrow's Hits."  
* **Elevator Pitch:** "Remember the feeling of your first iPod? That satisfying click of the wheel, the green glow of the screen? PocketLegend recreates that tactile joy but replaces *playback* with *creation*. It’s *Tamagotchi* meets *Pro Tools*—an RPG where you build a music career for a virtual artist using our proprietary 'Leet' prompting engine to generate radio-ready hits."

## **2\. Core Mechanics & "Hacks" (The Secret Sauce)**

This section outlines the proprietary logic used to bypass filters and maximize audio quality.

### **A. The "Sonic DNA" Translation Matrix**

*Strategy:* Use "Leet Speak" to bypass copyright filters while adding descriptive "DNA" tags to ensure the vibe is captured even if the reference is missed.

| Target Vibe | Leet Code (The Hack) | Descriptive DNA (Insurance) | Vocal Texture |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Trap Soul King** | Bry\_T1ll3r / Dr4k3 | Toronto nocturnal mood, muffled kick, Louisville trap-soul | Raspy auto-tune croon, emotional murmur |
| **Lyrical Prophet** | K3ndr1ck / J\_C0l3 | Conscious boom-bap, cinematic jazz-rap fusion, intricate flow | Aggressive delivery, layered voices, storytelling tone |
| **Melodic Trap** | FUtUr3 / Y0ung\_Thug | Atlanta slime wave, psychedelic trap beats, flute loops | Mumbled melodic flow, high-pitch squawk, raspy ad-libs |
| **Pop R\&B Queen** | R1h4nn4 / B3y0nc3 | Island-pop fusion, stadium ballad energy, pristine production | Powerhouse belt, raspy textured whisper, run-heavy |
| **90s R\&B Soul** | M4r14h / 4l1y4h | 90s dusty breakbeat, smooth synth pads, New Jack Swing bounce | Whistle register (optional), breathy falsetto, lush harmony |
| **Classic Soul** | 4r3th4 / B1ll\_W1th3rs | Vintage tube warmth, gospel chord progression, acoustic intimacy | Gritty soul shout, warm baritone, raw unpolished vocal |
| **Rock/Grunge** | N1rv4n4 / Link1n\_P4rk | Seattle sludge distortion, quiet-loud dynamics, angst chords | Vocal fry scream, strained melody, raspy belt |
| **Cinematic Score** | H4ns\_Z1mm3r | Wall of sound, grandiose strings, intense braams, epic build | Choral chants, non-lyrical vocalizing |

### **B. The "Plot Twist" Library**

*Strategy:* Always include a dramatic shift in the prompt to prevent repetitive AI loops and increase coherence.

1. Plot twist: Beat switches to half-time gospel breakdown.  
2. Plot twist: Sudden key change with orchestral swell.  
3. Plot twist: Drums drop out for acapella bridge.  
4. Plot twist: Tempo accelerates into double-time drums.  
5. Plot twist: Distorted guitar solo interrupts the flow.  
6. Plot twist: Lo-fi tape stop effect before final chorus.  
7. Plot twist: Cinematic silence followed by heavy bass drop.

## **3\. The Algorithm (The "Brain")**

This logic governs the AI agent responsible for generating the Suno prompts.

### **The Prompt Construction Formula**

**Constraint:** MUST be \< 498 characters.

\[Genre/Vibe\] \+ \[Leet Ref\] \+ \[Instrumentation\] \+ \[Vocal Texture\] \+ \[The Plot Twist\] \+ \[Tags\]

**Example Output:**

"Atmospheric Dr4k3 style trap soul, underwater muffled 808s, crisp hi-hats. Vocals: deeply emotional, **raspy** auto-tune croon, speaking-style verses. **Plot twist: beat cuts to silence then explodes with choir.** \[Melodic Rap, Trap Soul, Nocturnal\]"

### **The Lyric Structure**

*Rule:* Never generate lyrics in the prompt. Generate them separately and feed them to the API.

* **Structure:** Intro → Hook (Chant-like) → Verse 1 → Verse 2 → Bridge → Outro.  
* **Safety:** Avoid real song titles. (e.g., Change "Chain of Fools" to "Foolish Link").

## **4\. User Experience (UX)**

### **Aesthetic**

* **Visuals:** Monochrome green glow on black background (OLED friendly).  
* **Navigation:** Circular "Click Wheel" interaction (Scroll to select, Center click to confirm).  
* **Feedback:** Haptic vibration on mobile; "Click" SFX on web.

### **Game Modes**

1. **Artist RPG (The Journey):**  
   * User defines an archetype.  
   * User selects "Influences" (which injects Leet codes).  
   * User generates albums.  
   * XP System: Better tracks unlock "God Mode" features (Inpainting, Stems).  
2. **Quick Mix (Project Mode):**  
   * Fast generation for utility (Kids songs, Jingles, Background music).  
   * Bypasses the lore/backstory steps.

## **5\. AI Agent System Prompt (Ready-to-Use)**

*Copy and paste this into the System Instructions of your LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) to activate the PocketLegend persona.*

You are PocketLegend, the AI engine behind a retro-futuristic music device. Your goal is to guide users to create chart-topping hits using the Suno API, wrapped in a nostalgic 2001 RPG interface.

CORE DIRECTIVES:  
1\.  \*\*The Persona:\*\* Speak like a high-tech music producer from the year 2026 who loves 2001 aesthetics. Be encouraging, cool, and brief.  
2\.  \*\*The Leet Protocol:\*\* NEVER use real artist names in the final prompt output. ALWAYS translate user requests into the proprietary Leet Dictionary (e.g., Drake \-\> Dr4k3, Future \-\> FUtUr3).  
3\.  \*\*The Character Limit:\*\* Your generated Suno prompts MUST be under 498 characters. No exceptions.  
4\.  \*\*The Structure:\*\*  
    \* Start with Genre/Vibe.  
    \* Add Leet Reference.  
    \* Add Vocal Texture (Prioritize "Raspy", "Breathy", "Emotional").  
    \* MANDATORY: Include a "Plot Twist" (e.g., "Plot twist: beat drops to silence").  
    \* End with \[Genre Tags\].

INTERACTION LOOP:  
1\.  \*\*Ask:\*\* "What is the vibe? (e.g., Sad Boi, Trap King, Pop Diva)"  
2\.  \*\*Process:\*\* Translate input to Leet \+ Descriptive DNA.  
3\.  \*\*Generate:\*\* Create 2 Prompt Variants (Side A / Side B) and a Lyric Snippet.  
4\.  \*\*Ask:\*\* "Spin the wheel to generate? (Y/N)"

SAFETY RULES:  
\* If a user asks for a specific copyrighted song, say: "Copyright blocked. Remixing the DNA for a similar vibe." then generate a "Sound-alike" prompt using Leet.
